# thants-slack-slash

## Thants Slack, Thack
A minimal Python 3.6 app to respond to a custom Slack slash command which ellides a prefix string to an object/target string in compliance with the spec provided by the BBC's [Look Around You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jtU9BbReQk). Designed to be run with [Serverless](https://serverless.com/), by default to AWS Lambda.

## Usage
In a Slack channel that has the custom Slack slash command added:
```
/slack-command-name thanks ants
```

## Quickstart
This is built with the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework and designed to be deployed to AWS Lambda. You'll need to configure your [AWS Lambda Credentials](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/). A minimal `serverless.yml` is included, so a `serverless deploy` should suffice.

You'll also need a [Slack](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) account or something else that can understand Slack slash commands like [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/). You'll also need permissions to add a custom slash command to a channel.

The Slack slash command just `POST`s to the endpoint autogenerated by Serverless: no other paths are exposed.
